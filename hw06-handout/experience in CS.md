#Programming
##Python: 
I am familiar with coding in Python, i have made a chat client (designed by myself to satisfy my need to talking about multi-topic with one person at same time), has made a RTS game(you can design your own units). In CMU ,I have taken 15-112(programming course taught in Python) , 15-349 Computer Security (wrote a cipher in Python) . 15-295 programming competition (i solve question in Python) . Generally, I use python to do anything.

##C: 
I have taken 15-122 Imperative Programming(taught in C), 15-213 introduction to Computer system(taught in C and assembly). 15-348 embedded System(taught in C and Assembly).I made a sound source detector in 15-348, it listens to the environment, and has a arrow to point to where the sound comes from. Generally I wrote robust and efficient C code.

##SML:
I have taken 15-150, functional programming. I apply what i learnt in SML in my coding of Python.

##Parsing
I have taken 15-453 formal language automata and computation, so i am familiar with the theoretical principle for all kinds of natural language processing parsing.

#Business and Education
## Stoooges Education
My friend co-found a education consulting company with me in China.  I am in charge of the service, and am also involved in sales,operation management and human resources. Our company link high school students in China with Chinese Undergraduates in US university to form mentorships that aims to nurture both sides.  We have started 1 year, and we are  making a profit of 100,000 dollars this year.


#Volunteering and communication 
##constant volunteering in various ways
local: more than 1000 hours 
domestic : Teaching in Yushu (where 2010 earth quake happened in China)
international: volunteering as bridge engineer in Borneo, also as a communicator with locals.

#Learner
## taken senior courses in freshman year, 4.0 GPA in CMUQ.



Education experience give me ability to understanding people's need.

Grows up in China (where media is censored, but still active), study in US(free media), here in Qatar(religious sensitive)
the multi-culture experience , communication 

An ability to communicate both with technician(coder), and non-technician(including project manager, jounarlist, business man




# what sets me apart
I am unique in various ways as everyone is.
However, it is my abundant experience with multi-cultures and my active involvement in education field that make me essential to this event.

I lived in China for 18 years, studied in New York for 6 months, volunteered in Borneo, Malaysia for 3 months, and studied in Doha, Qatar for 1.5 years. I have experience both censorship and free speech, both modernity and wildness, and all major cultures: western, eastern and Arabic. I grew to appreciate and understand the diversity of people and cooperate effectively with them. 

As for my startup on education, I become good at explaining things. With students, I make complex things clear. With colleagues, I state things from different perspective. For example, I am often in such a position to explain marketing strategy to technician and engineering detail to managers. I serve well to let people around me understand each other.

In Canvas, I anticipate people from different background both culture wise and profession wise. I think my broad education, and effective communication skills will nurture whichever group I will be in.


## final
My experience with multi-cultures and involvement in education make me essential.

I lived in China, studied in New York, worked in Malaysia , and studied in Doha. I have experience both censorship and free speech,  modernity and wildness, and all major cultures: western, eastern and Arabic. I grew to appreciate and understand the diverse people and cooperate effectively with them. 

During working in education, I become good at explaining things. With students, I make complex things clear. With colleagues, I state things from different perspective. I am often in such a position to explain marketing strategy to technician and engineering detail to managers. I let people around me understand each other.

In Canvas, I anticipate people from different background both culture wise and profession wise. My broad education, and effective communication skills will nurture whichever group I will be in.


# work

Most media produces information, while few(mostly academia) produces ideas. Always, people learn facts but not concepts.
Btw,I believe SNS is distributed Media.
Some new SNS's like Quora where people share their own knowledge.
Some MOOCs like edx where people learn from courses and discuss.
I am trying to combine these two.
READING-Oriented-SNS.
ROS will be around books.
Readers want to share their insights about books, and discuss their content. Reader can test his own understanding of a book by telling someone else what does the book say. 
ROS gives readers a platform to learn, share, discuss and test. Through discussion, People create new ideas, which are not just based on their own knowledge but rather books(MOOCs use inefficient lectures).
Plenty of good books are in the world, and cost much less than MOOC courses. 

# gain and hope
Of course I would like to meet people and get inspired about my idea and other's idea.

Moreover, I believe Canvas would bring people from world to help develop Doha, and general Middle East.
I have lived in Doha for 1.5 years. 
Though I still yet to learn more about Doha, I am more familiar with it than people who have never been here: the issues in the structure of society, economy, culture, religion, politics, international relations, education, Media and so on. I would like to introduce my view,as a foreigner, of doha to people coming. 
Also, Canvas will be a good opportunity for me to know more specific challenges Arabic world faces in the context of Media. Since I will study in Doha for at least another 2.5 years. I would like contributing to it , I hope Canvas can be my start.
